<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Schindler's list</h3>

<p>This problably one of the most beautiful movies ttha I'va ever watched because not aonly the story is baed in real facts but the music, performances,and photograph is beatiful but also is a reminder that even in times where most of the people can be evil; some of us can choose to be kind to others.

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>

<p> This is my favorite anime movie, all the elements here are awesome and really beatiful besides the whole music is great. If I have to reccomend a animated movie to watch this will be my #1.

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>

<p>The whole movie is hilarious but at the same interesting because is a mix of aventure, romance, humor, and more. Besides all the performances are marvelous in this Sci-Fi movie.
